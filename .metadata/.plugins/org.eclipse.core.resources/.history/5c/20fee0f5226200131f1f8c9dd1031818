# Numbers in lists by SeanMc from forums
# define a procedure that takes in a string of numbers from 1-9 and
# outputs a list with the following parameters:
# Every number in the string should be inserted into the list.
# If the first number in the string is greater than or equal 
# to the proceeding number, the proceeding number should be inserted 
# into a sublist. Continue adding to the sublist until the proceeding number 
# is greater than the first number before the sublist. 
# Then add this bigger number to the normal list.

#Hint - "int()" turns a string's element into a number

'''
Pseudo code - brainstorm algorithm
create empty list
add first number to list
check proceeding number
    if it's smaller than or equal to the first num:
    then insert into it's own sub list
    else if it's bigger than the first number:
    just add it to the list as usual
next number: 
    if smaller than or equal to the first num: 
    insert into same list as sublist
    else if it's bigger than first num: 
    just add to list as usual, not into sublist
continue until no more numbers
